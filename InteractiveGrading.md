# Interactive Grading Session Requirements

Each student is required to complete two interactive *project* grading sessions
with Sami. Guidelines for the interactive grading sessions are as follows:

### Logistics:

- Prior to each Project deadline, an opportunity to sign up for a 30-minute
  interactive grading session for that project will be posted on Teams and the
  class website.
- Students must sign up at least 24 hours in advance of the Project deadline.
- Sign ups are first come, first served. If you are unable to secure a slot
  for a given project you must wait until the next project to complete an
  interactive grading session. There will be a sufficient number of slots for
  every student to have two sessions over the six projects required for the
  class. 

### What to expect:

- Sami will download and run your solution. You may be asked to explain any
  unexpected program behavior or errors. *Be prepared for Sami to test possible
  edge cases and erroneous input!*
- Sami will ask you to describe the overall design of your solution. You should
  be prepared to discuss your program decomposition including the functions you
  implemented.
- You may be asked to explain any implementation decisions you made. This could
  include variable naming, how you implemented various elements of the program
  logic, or how you chose to handle particular cases.
- You may be asked other questions about topics such as which parts of the
  program you are most proud to have completed, which parts of the program were
  most challenging, or what you learned from implementing the program. 
- Sami will ask whether you have any other questions or elements of your
  program that you would like to discuss.

### Hints:

- You do not need to prepare anything specific for the interactive grading
  session. You are not expected to prepared slides. You should think through
  what you have learned from the assignment and what you are proud to have accomplished.
- Though it can be stressful, use the session as an opportunity to practice
  talking about code. This is a critical skill you must develop if you want to
  be successful in the computing industry.
