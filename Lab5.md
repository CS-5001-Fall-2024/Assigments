# Lab 5 - Code Review and Revision
### Due - Monday, October 7, 2024

Assignment Link:

<hr/>

This lab assignment requires the following concepts:
- Revising code
- Reading code

For this assignment, you will complete the following two programs:

## Revised Recipe Helper
**You may choose to work with a partner on this assignment (but you may also
choose to work alone). If working in a team, each student must still submit a
solution to their repository, but it is acceptable for those solutions to be the
same. At the top of the program, include a documentation block with the names of
the students who worked together on the assignment.**

For this assignment, you will revise your recipe helper solution as follows:

1. If the user enters an invalid measurement (i.e., 2 bananas) use a *loop* to print an error message and request that the user enter a valid measurement.
2. Use a *loop* to allow the user to continue to perform conversions for additional ingredients until they wish to quit.
3. Make sure to fix any outstanding bugs from your original solution.

**Submission:** This program must be submitted in a file called *revised_recipe_helper.py* in your Lab 5 repository.

## Code Review
For this question, you will do a code review of an existing Python program that
implements Rock/Paper/Scissors. Your code review must include at least **five**
substantive comments about the code. 

**Option 1:** For option 1 you will work with a partner and each review the other person's solution.

**Option 2:**  For option 2 you will search the web for a Python Rock/Paper Scissors solution and submit a review of that solution.

**Option 3:**  For option 3 you will use Chat GPT or another LLM to generate Rock/Paper Scissors solution and submit a review of that solution.

**Format:** Your code review will be implemented as comments embedded in the code itself. So, you will download the program and insert block comments with your feedback.

### Code Review Guidelines:

- You are encouraged to search the web for guidelines for doing a code review;
however, be aware that many web pages will have information that does not apply
in our context. 
- The Summary section at the bottom of this page is a good starting point: [https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/looking-for.html). Consider questions such as the following:
  * What good design practices does the code use? Are there any ways you would improve the design (e.g., how the program is broken into functions)?
  * Are variables and functions named appropriately?
  * Is the program documented well? Does it include comments that appropriately describe the design and functionality?
  * Does the logic make sense? Could it be implemented in a way that would be easier to read?
  * Are there any obvious errors you see in the program?

**Submission:** This program must be submitted in a file called *rps_review.py* in your Lab 5 repository.

## Assignment Submission

To earn credit for this assignment you must commit all of your changes to your GitHub repository prior to the deadline. It is strongly recommended that you commit your changes regularly. Do not wait until you complete all parts of the assignment to upload your (partial) solution.

Step 1 - *Stage Changes*: Select the Source Control icon in the VSCode left menu. In the Changes section, click the + to *Stage All Changes*.

Step 2 - Commit Message: In the text box that says Message enter a meaningful message that describes the change you just completed.

Step 3 - *Commit & Push*: Select the down arrow in the blue box that says Commit. Choose *Commit & Push*.

Step 4 - Verify: Visit the repository on GitHub to confirm that your changes were uploaded successfully
